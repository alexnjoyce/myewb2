Hey <%= model.get('name').split(' ')[0] %>!

Hope you are doing very well.

I just noticed that you aren't registered yet for the 10th Anniversary 2011 EWB National Conference . I'd love to see you there and hang out. Any chance you can make it?

You should check out the new conference networking site at {{site_link}} to see who else is coming. It's a bit addictive so be careful!

Hope to see you in Toronto in January!
